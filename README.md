Expense Tracker
A simple and lightweight expense tracker to help you manage your income, expenses, and savings efficiently.

Features
Add and track income, expenses, and savings
User-friendly interface
Data stored locally for quick access
Limitations
Since this project is hosted on GitHub Pages, we have some limitations:

There's no backend support to store data permanently
Usernames, passwords, income, expenses, and savings data are saved using browser's local storage, meaning they are only accessible on the same device and browser
Future Improvements
Implementing backend storage for better data persistence
Adding authentication for secure login across devices
